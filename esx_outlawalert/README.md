# esx_outlawalert

### About
Outlaw Alert is an resource that detects if the player either steals an vehicle, fires a weapon or if the player is fighting another player / ped.
Fork of the original resource which has the following changes: made esx compatible, it shows alert to cops when shooting, carjacking or fighting.
I have added some extra features to support alerts on my ATM Robbery and New Drugs System.
